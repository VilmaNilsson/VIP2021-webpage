            span Some shit has gone down in the Spiral Star Galaxy,
            span and you have to solve it
         p The designated dump planet Trashzonia has exploded and now trash is floating around everywhere in the galaxy. It is an ecological disaster on an astronomical scale. Since capitalism is king, the Galaxy Federation has hired private contractors, including you and your crew, to collect this garbage and dispose of it. You will be rewarded greatly for your work, but watch out for the other crews!<br>They might want all of the rewards for themselves…

            p In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Oh wait, that’s the beginning of another story. Our story has a different one. But how does it end? Nobody knows just yet. Every day we keep getting closer to an answer, and through the patterns of life in space we can slowly see the outlines of what the outcome of this shitstorm will be.
            p The teams have gone into slay-mode. They haven't slept for weeks and judging from their schedule it’s not happening anytime soon. No more landing on planets, no more fikas with the crews, no more happy hours on board of the mainship. Deadline is no longer weeks or months away. Now we are counting down days. Soon those days will be hours. We need to work. Harder, better, faster, stranger. There’s no turning back now.
            p PS. Johannes is still missing. Please contact us if you see him.

               p The deadline is creeping up behind the sun and the teams are now flying around like beheaded hens hoping to make it on time. They have reached the point of no return, so now is the time to let go of all fears, go full throttle and simply hope for the best.
               p Design team and UX are finally back in their right mind. Almost. The paranoia is still coming and going, hopefully it will wear off soon... The recovering from their little trip to Moo took longer than expected. Team is now a bit scattered since some of them are begging to go back, whilst the rest have gone into non-stop working mode. All have different coping-methods it seems.
               p The only team that is fairly well functioning is Development. Their adventure to Margreth really brought them together as a family. The atmosphere in their ship is now so sweet that the walls are getting sticky.
               p Johannes is still mysteriously lost, and the hunt for him keeps getting harder since nobody remembers his appearance. The teams had a gathering a few days ago to put their brilliant minds together. Ambition was to make a sketch of Johannes' face before all memory was gone. Went quite well actually. If you happen to see him, please tell him to answer our texts and come home. We think that we miss him.

               p The Development crew made a questionable choice this week and entered Uranus. Even though the Design crew warned them of the smelly volkano they simply couldn’t curb their enthusiasm. After an interesting little adventure into the depths of Uranus some are more happy than others. No names mentioned. There were a few days where the ship was filled with thunderous awkward silence. Vilma used this to her advantage and convinced the team to visit the newly discovered planet Margreth. They are now sitting on a porch drinking tea from tiny cups and gossiping about all the neighbouring planets.
               p The design team has also gotten stuck on a planet. They landed on Moo to get some artistic inspiration from the cows. A factor they did not expect was what the fumes of cow excrement would do to their normally sharp as a knife minds.  They are now sitting in the grass giggling, speaking incohesively about the meaning of life and singing Kumbaya. They said something on the intercom about Johannes visiting them, but they also said something about fungus having a mind of their own, so we are not quite sure of what to believe. Someone needs to get them out of there ASAP. They are definitely not able to fly their ship by themselves.
               p Anyhow, everything isn’t all bad in the Spiral Star Galaxy. The UX crew has been found! After their adventure to Moo they are unfortunately in the same state of mind as the Design crew. How they got back out in space is still a mystery to the rest of us. After they have had their ignition we will send them to bounty hunt our bounty hunter.

               p The Development Crew is floating in Uranus’ orbit, working nonstop to achieve greatness, and thus the ship is disgusting but the crew is happier than ever. They have discovered a new planet and the co-captains Vilma and Sebastian are in disagreement. Vilma thinks that they should visit the planet and discover its environment whereas Sebastian thinks that would be too time consuming. As these two discuss pros and cons we shall update you on the Design Crew.
               p The Design Crew is preparing to walk in space for the millionth time, but this time they will try to board the abandoned GG-ship. Their mission is to collect space dust that will make paint. Yes, the Design Crew is very ambitious and needs every detail to be perfect, so they go to space to collect space dust for one purpose, and one purpose only: to make you, the gamer, appreciate the game that little bit more. 
               p No one has seen the UX crew since they went to the dark side of the moon of Moo, their last words were “how could you have forgotten to design an off...” and then they went silent. To rescue the UX crew we have sent our bounty hunter Johannes, but sadly we haven't seen him for a long time. We still have hope, but we fear the worst.
