          h3 KIM
          p We had to create a planet in honour of our project manager, eh, I mean our Lord and saviour, Kim. No man is an island, but Kim is a planet.

          h3 URANUS
          p It’s true, every galaxy has a Uranus, this galaxy’s is just a bit more literal.  The natives have one rule, and one rule only, don’t go near the smelly volcano.

          h3 MARGARETH

          p Where do all of the nice grandmas go when they die? To heaven? Well, this one made it all the way to space. This is Margareth, the Spiral Star galaxy’s very own, personal  grandma. She used to knit and bribe her grandchildren, but now she can only watch, which is perfectly fine with her, because spying on her neighbours used to be one of her favourite hobbies.

          h3 DEAD EARTH

          p Once upon a time, there was Planet Earth, but not anymore. Humans and animals lived in peace until one day when a sweet little girl named Greta sat outside the Parliament in Stockholm with a sign saying: "School strike for the climate", protesting against climate change. One day the US president posted a tweet saying ”Chill, Greta. Chill!”, but no one was listening to Greta. Yeah, Greta could chill, but the climate couldn't.
